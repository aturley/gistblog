"Github would be my one-stop tool if I could use it to power a blog."
-- Davis Barber (paraphrased)

@barberdt made a comment a while back about how it would be cool to be
able to run a blog completely from inside Github. Now our particular
engineering organization has a general mistrust of anything that
sounds like "Wouldn't it be cool if ...", because this has a bad habit
of being uttered just before an half-baked demand on someone else's
time. But every once in a while an idea like that sits in the back of
your head, and eventually you stuble across a half-baked solution to
the half-baked idea.

So here we are.

This project is a proof-of-concept for creating a blog completely
inside github.
